  <h3>Forever and Always</h3>
  <p>Once upon a time
  <br>I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
  <br>And we caught on to something
  <br>I hold on to the night
  <br>you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me</p>
  <p>Were you just kidding?
  <br>&lsquo;Cause it seems to me
  <br>this thing is breaking down
  <br>We almost never speak
  <br>I don&rsquo;t feel welcome anymore
  <br>Baby what happened? Please tell me</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Cause one second it was perfect,
  <br>now you&rsquo;re halfway out the door</p>
