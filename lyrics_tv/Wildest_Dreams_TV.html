  <h2>(Taylor's Version)</h2>
  <h3>Dr. Taylor Swift</h3>

	<p>He said, "<em>Lets get out of this town<br>
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds</em>"<br>
I thought heaven can't help me now<br>
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down</p>

	<p>He's so tall and handsome as hell<br>
He's so bad but he does it so well<br>
I can see the end as it begins<br>
My one condition is</p>

	<p>Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress<br>
Staring at the sunset, babe<br>
<!--Send Help-->
Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
Say you'll see me again<br>
Even if it's just in your<strong> wildests dreams</strong>, ah-ha<br>
<strong>Wildest dreams</strong>, ah-ha</p>
<!-- If you're a swiftie, send help, preferably a jet -->
