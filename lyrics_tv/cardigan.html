  <h3>cardigan</h3><em>Dr. Taylor Alison Swift</em>
  <p>Vintage tee, brand new phone
  <br>High heels on cobblestones
  <br>When you are young, they assume you know nothing</p>
  <p>Sequin smile, black lipstick
  <br>Sensual politics
  <br>When you are young, they assume you know nothing</p>
  <p>But I knew you
  <br>Dancin' in your Levi's
  <br>Drunk under a streetlight, I
  <br>I knew you
  <br>Hand under my sweatwhirt
  <br>Baby, kiss it better, I</p>
  <p>And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
  <br>Under someone's bed
  <br>You put me on and said I was your favorite<p>
  <p>A friend to all is a friend to none
  <br>Chase two girls, lose the one
  <br>When you are young, they assume you know nothin'</p>
