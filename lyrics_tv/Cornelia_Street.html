  <h1>Cornelia Street</h1>
  <h3>Dr. Taylor Swift</h3>
  <p>  We were in the <strong>backseat</strong>
  <br> Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
  <br>"<em>I rent a place on Cornelia Street</em>"
  <br> I say casually in the car
  <br> We were a <strong>fresh page</strong> on the desk
  <br> Filling in the blanks as we go
  <br> As if the street lights pointed in an <em>arrowhead</em>
  <br> Leading us <strong>home</strong>
  </p> And I hope I never lose you, hope it never <strong>ends</strong>
  <br> I'd never walk <em>Cornelia Street</em> again
  <br> That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend
  <br> I'd never walk <em>Cornelia Street</em> again</p>
<!--But not as much as she loves William Bowery-->
