  <h3>All Too Well</h3>
  <p>I walked through the door with you
  <br>The air was cold
  <br>But something about it felt like home somehow
  <br>And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
  <br>And you've still got it in your drawer even now</p>
  <p>Oh, your sweet disposition
  <br>And my wide-eyed gaze
  <br>We're singing in your car, getting lost upstate
  <br>And I an picture it after all these days</p>
  <p>And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
  <br>And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all</p>
  <p>'Cause there we are again on that little town street
  <br>You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
  <br>Wind in my hair, I was there
  <br>I remember it, all too well</p>
