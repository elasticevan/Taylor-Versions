  <h1>Renegade <em>feat. Big Red Machine</em></h1>
  <p>I tapped on your window on your darkest night
  <br>The shape of you, was jagged and weak
  <br>There was nowhere for me to stay
  <br>But I stayed anyway
  <br>And if I would've known
  <br>How many pieces you had crumbled into
  <br>I might've let them lay</p>
  <p>Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
  <br>And let all your damage damage me
  <br>And carry your baggage up my street
  <br>And make your future history
  <br>It's time, you've come a long way
  <br>Open the blinds, let me see your face
  <br>You wouldn't be the first renegade
  <br>To need somebody</p>
